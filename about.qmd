## Bio

I worked in development research and financial regulation before starting to pursue economics seriously in 2020.

Following a year of graduate studies in applied economics at the University of Maryland, I joined the research group of Prof. David Bloom at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health as a predoctoral research assistant with a portfolio centered on the economics of health and population.

I then joined the Research Department of the Inter-American Development Bank as a research fellow supporting Razvan Vlaicu's agenda on financial inclusion.

I chose to pursue doctoral studies at Brown University on its economics department's strengths in long-run growth and international macro.
